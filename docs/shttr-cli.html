It handles creating apps, creating and removing pages, managing build-time and runtime NodeJS dependencies, running the development server, and debugging and deploying apps. It also manages your installed Shell on the Shttr runtime.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="creating-apps" data-toc="creating-apps">Creating Apps</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
shttr n
shttr new
shttr n app_name
shttr n app_name --bootstrap
shttr n app_name --tailwind
shttr n app_name --empty
</div><p id="z4a4g6f_16">Running <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_17">shttr n</code>, or <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_18">shttr new</code> will create a new Shell on the Shttr project. It takes the app name as an argument, and optionally takes a framework specifier after the app name. By default, running <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_19">shttr n test_app</code> will create a Shttr project called &quot;test_app&quot; populated with the default test site. This is the recommended way to get started, as you can immediately run the test server to confirm that it's all working. Optionally, you can run <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_20">shttr n test_app --boostrap</code> or <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_21">shttr n test_app --tailwind</code> to generate empty projects preconfigured to use Bootstrap or TailwindCSS respectively. You also have the option to run <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_22">shttr n test_app --empty</code> to generate an entirely empty project with no pages and no preconfigured frontend frameworks. Shttr CLI also initializes all new apps as git repos.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="generating-assets" data-toc="generating-assets">Generating Assets</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
shttr g page page_name
shttr generate page page_name
</div><p id="z4a4g6f_24">You can use <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_25">shttr g</code> or <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_26">shttr generate</code> to generate assets for your app. Currently, there is only one supported generator, the page generator. You would run <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_27">shttr g page [page name]</code> to generate a new page with your selected name. This creates the proper entrypoint script in <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_28">cgi-bin</code>, a barebones controller, a blank model, and a barebones view for your page. If Shttr CLI finds a nav.html file in your shared views, that file will be included in your new page's view underneath app.html.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="deleting-assets" data-toc="deleting-assets">Deleting Assets</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
shttr r page page_name

</div><p id="z4a4g6f_30">The opposite of the generator, <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_31">shttr r</code> or <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_32">shttr remove</code> deletes assets from your app. Much like the generator, it only supports pages at the moment. Running <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_33">shttr r page [page name]</code> would remove the entrypoint, controller, model, and view associated with the page name supplied.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="compiling-static-assets" data-toc="compiling-static-assets">Compiling Static Assets</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">

Because Shttr supports sass as well as css, and because the sass compiler is slow, the compile step is not run by default on every deploy or server operation. You should really only run the compile step if you've recently updated your stylesheets.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="managing-runtime-nodejs-dependencies" data-toc="managing-runtime-nodejs-dependencies">Managing Runtime NodeJS Dependencies</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
shttr npm i
shttr npm i node_package
shttr npm uninstall node_package
</div><p id="z4a4g6f_39">Your app's runtime NodeJS dependencies are handled by using <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_40">shttr npm</code>. This supports any standard npm command, and ensures that all NodeJS packages are installed into the proper app directory. For example, <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_41">shttr npm i @domchristie/turn</code> would install the Turn javascript library into your app as a runtime dependency, and <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_42">shttr npm uninstall @domchristie/turn</code> would remove it.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="running-the-server" data-toc="running-the-server">Running the Server</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
shttr s
shttr server
shttr s --production
</div><p id="z4a4g6f_44">You can use <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_45">shttr s</code> or <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_46">shttr server</code> to run the Shttr server. This will build a Docker image and then run the integrated Apache web server, which can be accessed at localhost:3000. This approach ensures consistency between the development and production environment. The server optionally takes <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_47">--production</code> as a command line flag, which will run the server in production mode. At the moment, this switch controls whether or not live-reloading is enabled, but once Shttr SQL is released, this switch will also allow for different development and production databases to be used. In development mode, the development files in <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_48">shttr</code> and <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_49">cgi-bin</code> are bind-mounted within the Docker container so that any changes you make while the server is running will immediately be reflected in the running server. In production mode, the source files are copied into the Docker image and so the site is read-only while the server is running.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="debugging-pages" data-toc="debugging-pages">Debugging Pages</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
shttr debug page_name
</div><p id="z4a4g6f_51">The Shttr debugger can be run using <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_52">shttr debug [page name]</code>. This will create an environment that mimics the CGI environment of the server and runs the page scripts, ultimately outputting the resultant HTML as plain text to teh console. The debugger is also looking for any instances of <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_53">dbg_break</code> in your scripts. Any occurrence of <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_54">dbg_break</code> will pause execution at that point and drop you into a shell where any valid shell command is available to you to run at that exact point in the execution of the script. This is useful for inspecting variables at various points in the page's execution, or testing how different functions react to different values without having to edit your source files. Running <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_55">continue</code> at the debugger shell prompt will resume execution. You can have as many instances of <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_56">dbg_break</code> as you like, the debugger will simply pause at each one of them as it gets to them.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="deploying-pages" data-toc="deploying-pages">Deploying Pages</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
shttr d
shttr deploy
shttr d -c
</div><p id="z4a4g6f_58">In order to deploy your Shttr apps, you'll run <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_61">shttr d</code> or <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_62">shttr deploy</code>. Adding the <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_63">-c</code> flag to the deploy command will run the compile step prior to building the image and deploying. Shttr CLI will read the values in your app's <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_64">config.sh</code> file to determine how to deploy the app. You'll set your deployment target as the value of <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_65">DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> in <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_66">config.sh</code>. Currently, there are two supported deployment targets: <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_67">systemd</code> and <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_68">static</code>; and one experimental target: <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_69">aws</code>. The <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_70">systemd</code> target will deploy your app over SSH to a remote server with Docker installed and register itself as a SystemD service on that server. You'll then need to set up a web server and a reverse proxy to localhost:3000 on the server. This deployment target is very convenient for users of VPS services, since as long as your server already has Docker installed and your reverse proxy is set up, you can deploy your app with a single command.</p><p id="z4a4g6f_59">The <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_71">static</code> target will compile your app to a static site placed in the <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_72">static</code> directory in the root of your project. This target doesn't support any of Shttr's dynamic rendering, or features like ShttrDB, but it's very useful for those who want to use Shttr's templating and tooling to build their static site. Sites generated with the <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_73">static</code> target are suitable for deployment to GitHub Pages, or other such static hosting services.</p><p id="z4a4g6f_60">The <code class="code" id="z4a4g6f_74">aws</code> target produces a zip file which can be deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk as a Docker image. This is still a bit experimental because it doesn't yet support features like ShttrDB, so there won't be any option for persistent storage for apps deployed in this way yet.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="updating-the-system-s-shttr-runtime" data-toc="updating-the-system-s-shttr-runtime">Updating the System's Shttr Runtime</h2><div class="code-block" data-lang="bash">

Be careful doing this, as it is a one-way process, and since Shell on the Shttr is still under heavy development, breaking changes are to be expected. Make sure you understand what's changed in the new Shell on the Shttr runtime and why you need to update before running this command.</p></section><div class="last-modified">22 March 2024</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="discover-shttr.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Discover Shttr</a><a href="anatomy-of-a-shttr-app.html" class="navigation-links__next">Anatomy of a Shttr App</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.22.0-b776/app.js"></script></body></html>
